The algorithm in `String_LPS.cpp` computes the length of the Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) in a given string.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main goal is to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string.

**Input:**
The function `longestPalindromeSubseq` takes as input a string `s`.

**Output:**
The function `longestPalindromeSubseq` returns the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in `s`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. The function starts by reversing the input string `s` and assigning it to `rs`.

2. It then calls the function `longestCommonSubsequence` with `s` and `rs` as inputs.

3. `longestCommonSubsequence` function first checks if the size of `text1` is less than the size of `text2`. If it is, it swaps `text1` and `text2`.

4. It then checks if either `text1` or `text2` is empty. If either is empty, it returns `0`.

5. It then converts `text1` and `text2` to integer arrays `A` and `B` where each character is represented by its alphabetical index (0-based index).

6. It calls the function `DP_LCS_Algorithm` with `A`, `B`, and their sizes as inputs. This function computes the length of the longest common subsequence between `A` and `B`.

7. Finally, `longestCommonSubsequence` returns the length of the longest common subsequence.

8. Because the longest common subsequence of a string and its reverse is a palindromic subsequence, `longestPalindromeSubseq` returns the length of the LPS.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it uses the dynamic programming approach to compute the length of the longest common subsequence.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it creates a 2D array of size n by n to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences for different prefixes of the string and its reverse.

Example: Given the input string `bbbab`, calling `longestPalindromeSubseq(s)` will return `4`, which is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence `bbbb`.
