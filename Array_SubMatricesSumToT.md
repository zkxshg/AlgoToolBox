The algorithm in `Array_SubMatricesSumToT.cpp` calculates the number of submatrices in a given 2D array whose sum is equal to a target value.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The algorithm's goal is to return the number of submatrices in a given 2D matrix whose elements sum up to a given target value.

**Input:**
The algorithm takes as input a 2D vector of integers `matrix` and an integer `target`.

**Output:**
The algorithm returns an integer which is the count of submatrices whose sum is equal to the target value.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Compute the prefix sum `psum` of each row in the `matrix`. The prefix sum of a sequence is a second sequence where the `i`-th entry is the sum of the first `i` entries of the original sequence.
2. Iterate over all pairs of rows `(x1, x2)` in the `matrix`. For each pair of rows, compute the row-wise sums `rsum` from `x1` to `x2` and store the frequency of these sums in a hash map `rres`.
3. For each row-wise sum `rsum`, check if `rsum - target` is present in the hash map. If it is, increment the result `res` by the frequency of `rsum - target` in `rres`.
4. After iterating over all pairs of rows, return the result `res`.

**Time complexity: O(n^2 * m)**, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the matrix. The algorithm iterates over all pairs of rows, and for each pair of rows, it iterates over all columns.

**Space complexity: O(n * m)**, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the matrix. The algorithm uses extra space for the prefix sum matrix and the hash map. 

This algorithm essentially uses a prefix sum and hash map to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in submatrices and to count the submatrices whose sum is equal to the target value.

For example, given the matrix `[[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]]` and `target = 0`, the output would be `4` because there are four submatrices whose sum of elements equals the target:
```
1. [0]
2. [0]
3. [0,1,0]
     [0,1,0]
4. [0,1,0]
     [1,1,1]
     [0,1,0]
```
