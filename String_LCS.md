The algorithm in `String_LCS.cpp` is an implementation of a method for finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings using a diagonal method.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main goal is to find the longest common subsequence between two given strings.

**Input:**
The `Diagonal_LCS` function takes two integer arrays `A` and `B`, their lengths `m` and `n`, and an integer `alphabet` representing the size of the alphabet.

**Output:**
The `Diagonal_LCS` function returns the length of the longest common subsequence between `A` and `B`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. The function begins by initializing `d_ij` which stores the smallest column index for each diagonal.

2. It then generates a successor table for `B` using the `succTable` function. This table is used to quickly find the next position of a given character in `B`.

3. The algorithm then iterates over `A`, and for each character, it tries to extend the subsequence on each diagonal.

4. For each diagonal, it updates `d_ij` with the minimum of its current value and the next position of the current character in `B`.

5. It also keeps track of the maximum length of the subsequence found so far.

6. The process continues until all characters in `A` are processed or the remaining characters in `A` are less than the maximum length of the subsequence found so far.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(mn), as it creates a successor table of size m by n and an integer array `d_ij` of length n.

Example: Given two strings `"abcde"` and `"ace"`, converted to integer arrays `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `[1, 3, 5]` with `alphabet` size 5, calling `Diagonal_LCS(A, B, 5, 3, 5)` will return `3`, which is the length of the longest common subsequence ("ace").
