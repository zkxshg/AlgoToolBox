The algorithm in `Bit_ReverseBits.cpp` reverses the binary representation of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The algorithm's purpose is to reverse the binary representation of a given 32-bit unsigned integer `n`.

**Input:**
The algorithm takes a 32-bit unsigned integer `n` as input.

**Output:**
The algorithm returns a 32-bit unsigned integer, which is the result of reversing the binary representation of `n`.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Convert the number `n` into its binary representation and store it in a `bitset` of 32 bits. A `bitset` is a container that stores individual bits.
2. Convert the `bitset` to a string `nstr`.
3. Reverse the string `nstr` using the `reverse` function.
4. Convert the reversed string back to a `bitset`.
5. Convert the `bitset` to an unsigned long integer `res`.
6. Finally, return `res` as the result.

**Time complexity: O(1)**, because the number of operations does not depend on the size of the input number and is constant.

**Space complexity: O(1)**, because the space used does not depend on the size of the input number and is constant.

This algorithm uses the `bitset` container and the `reverse` function to efficiently reverse the binary representation of a given number.

For example, given `n = 43261596` (which is `00000010100101000001111010011100` in binary), the output would be `964176192` (which is `00111001011110000010100101000000` in binary), because reversing the binary representation of `43261596` gives `964176192`.
