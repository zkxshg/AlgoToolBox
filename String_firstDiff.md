The algorithm in `String_firstDiff.cpp` is designed to find the first differing character position for all the possible string segment pairs within a given string.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The primary goal of this algorithm is to pre-calculate and store the first differing character position for all the substrings of the input string. 

**Input:**
The function `firstDiff` takes a string `num` as input.

**Output:**
The function `firstDiff` returns a 2D vector, where each element `diffs[i][j]` is the position of the first character that differs when comparing the substrings of `num` starting from index `i` and index `j`.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Resize the `diffs` vector to be of size `n x n`, where `n` is the size of the input string. Initialize all elements to -1.
2. For each pair of positions `(i, j)` in the string (with `i <= j`), compute and store the position of the first differing character in `diffs[i][j]`. This is done using the helper function `diff`, which uses recursion to find the first differing character. If `diffs[i][j]` has been computed before, it reuses the value instead of recomputing it.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where `n` is the size of the input string. This is because the algorithm needs to process all pairs of positions in the string.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n^2), due to the space required for the `diffs` vector to store the results for all pairs of positions in the string. 

For example, if the input string is "abcabc", the output 2D array will indicate the position of first differing character for each pair of substrings. For instance, `diffs[0][3]` will be 3, as the first differing character when comparing "abc" (starting at index 0) and "abc" (starting at index 3) is the end of string (index 3).
