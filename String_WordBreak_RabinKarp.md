The algorithm implemented in `String_WordBreak_RabinKarp.cpp` is a variation of the Rabin-Karp algorithm. However, this variation is more similar to the word break problem, using dynamic programming to check if a given string can be segmented into words from a provided dictionary.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The main goal of this algorithm is to determine if the string `s` can be segmented into one or more words present in the `wordDict`.

**Input:**
The function `RabinKarp` takes a string `s` and a vector of strings `wordDict` as input.

**Output:**
The function returns a boolean value. It returns `true` if the string `s` can be segmented into one or more words present in the `wordDict`. If not, it returns `false`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Edge Cases:** The algorithm first handles some edge cases. If `s` is empty, it returns `true`. If `wordDict` is empty, it returns `false`. If `s` is in `wordDict`, it returns `true`.

2. **Dictionary Creation:** The algorithm then creates a dictionary from `wordDict` for efficient lookup.

3. **String Segmentation:** The algorithm uses dynamic programming to determine if `s` can be segmented into words from `wordDict`. It creates a boolean array `dij`, where `dij[i]` is `true` if the substring `s[0..i-1]` can be segmented into words from `wordDict`. For each substring `s[j..i-1]`, if `dij[j]` is `true` and `s[j..i-1]` is in `wordDict`, it sets `dij[i]` to `true`.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm needs to check all substrings of `s`.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), due to the space required for the boolean array `dij` and the dictionary.

For example, given the input `s = "applepen"` and `wordDict = {"apple", "pen"}`, the `RabinKarp` function will return `true` as "applepen" can be segmented into "apple" and "pen", which are in `wordDict`.
