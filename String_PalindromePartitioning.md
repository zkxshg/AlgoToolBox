The algorithm implemented in `String_PalindromePartitioning.cpp` is designed to partition a string into all its possible palindrome substrings.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The main goal of this algorithm is to return all possible palindrome partitioning of a given string `s`.

**Input:**
The function `partition` takes a string `s` as input.

**Output:**
The function returns a 2D vector, where each inner vector represents a valid partitioning of the string into palindrome substrings.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Base Case:** If the string `s` has less than two characters, it returns the string `s` as a single partition.

2. **Partitioning:** The algorithm then tries to partition the string into substrings. It starts from the first character and checks each substring ending with the current character. If the substring is a palindrome, it adds it to the current partition and recursively applies the same process to the remaining part of the string. After each recursive call, it removes the last substring from the current partition to backtrack and try other possibilities.

3. **Palindrome Check:** The function `ifPali` is used to check if a substring is a palindrome. It compares the first and the last characters, then the second and the second last characters, and so on. If all pairs of characters are the same, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n * 2^n), where n is the length of the string. This is because, in the worst case, there are 2^n possible partitions of the string and it takes O(n) time to generate each partition.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), due to the space required to store the partitions and the recursive call stack.

For example, given the input `s = "aab"`, the `partition` function will return `{"a", "a", "b"}, {"aa", "b"}` as "a", "aa", and "b" are palindromes.
