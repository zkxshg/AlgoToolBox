The algorithm in `List_getMid.cpp` is an implementation of the Two Pointer Technique also known as **the Tortoise and the Hare algorithm**, which is used to find the middle node of a linked list.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main goal of this algorithm is to find the middle node of a given singly linked list.

**Input:**
The function `getMid` takes a pointer to the head node of a singly linked list.

**Output:**
The function returns the middle node of the linked list.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, at the head of the linked list.

2. In each step of the loop, move `fast` two steps and `slow` one step.

3. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the middle of the list.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited at most twice, once by the `slow` pointer and once by the `fast` pointer.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), since only a constant amount of space is used for the `slow` and `fast` pointers.

For example, if a linked list has nodes with values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be the node with value `3`, which is the middle node of the list.
