The algorithm in `List_SortedList2BalanceBST.cpp` is designed to convert a sorted singly linked list into a balanced binary search tree.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main goal of this algorithm is to convert a sorted linked list into a balanced binary search tree (BST) while maintaining the sorted order.

**Input:**
The function `sortedListToBST` takes a pointer to the head node of a sorted singly linked list.

**Output:**
The function returns the root node of the balanced BST.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. The `sortedListToBST` function first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns `NULL`.

2. It then creates a new node and assigns the value of the middle node of the list to this node.

3. It uses the `getMid` function to find the middle node of the list.

4. If the list has more than one node, it recursively inserts the nodes of the two halves of the list (to the right and left of the middle node) into the tree, by calling the `insertHead` function.

5. The `insertHead` function also uses `getMid` to divide the list and then recursively inserts the nodes into the tree.

6. The `insertTree` function inserts a node with a given value into the tree at the correct position.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N log N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because for each node, the algorithm performs a binary search to find its position in the tree.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the list. This space is used for the nodes of the tree.

For example, if a linked list has nodes with values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be a balanced BST with nodes in the order that an in-order traversal would return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
