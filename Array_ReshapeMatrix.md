The algorithm in `Array_ReshapeMatrix.cpp` is used for reshaping a 2D matrix to a new matrix with a different size while preserving its original data.

Here is the detailed breakdown of the algorithm:

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The goal of this algorithm is to reshape an m x n matrix into a different r x c size matrix while preserving the original data.

**Input:**
The algorithm takes as input a 2D matrix `mat` and two integers `r` and `c` which represent the number of rows and columns of the new reshaped matrix respectively.

**Output:**
The output of the algorithm is a reshaped 2D matrix of size r x c. If the reshaping isn't possible (i.e., the total number of elements in the original matrix isn't equal to the total number of elements in the reshaped matrix), the original matrix is returned.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. First, the algorithm checks if the reshaping is possible by comparing the total elements of the original and the reshaped matrices. If not, it returns the original matrix.
2. Next, it initializes a new 2D matrix `R` of size r x c.
3. Using a while loop, the algorithm traverses through each element in the original matrix and places it in the appropriate position in the reshaped matrix. The position in the reshaped matrix is calculated using integer division and modulo operations on the current position.
4. Finally, it returns the reshaped matrix.

**Time complexity: O(m * n).** The algorithm iterates through each element in the original matrix once, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the original matrix.

**Space complexity: O(r * c).** The algorithm creates a new matrix of size r x c to store the reshaped matrix. In the worst-case scenario where r * c equals m * n, the space complexity is proportional to the size of the input matrix.
