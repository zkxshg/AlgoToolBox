The algorithm in `String_LPSS.cpp` computes the Longest Palindromic Substring (LPS) in a given string.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main goal is to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

**Input:**
The function `longestPalindrome` takes as input a string `s`.

**Output:**
The function `longestPalindrome` returns the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. The function first checks if the length of the string `s` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `s` as the longest palindromic substring.

2. The function then initializes `maxL` as `1` and `maxS` and `maxE` as `0`. `maxL` will keep track of the length of the longest palindromic substring found so far, and `maxS` and `maxE` will keep track of its start and end indices in `s`, respectively.

3. The function then iterates over `s`. For each character `s[i]` in `s`, it checks if `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and if `s[i - 1]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` (if `i > 0`). These checks are done because a palindrome can have an even or odd length.

4. If `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i - 1]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, it initializes `st` and `en` as `i` and `i + 1` or `i - 1` and `i + 1`, respectively, and expands `st` and `en` as long as `s[st]` is equal to `s[en]`.

5. If the length of the string between `st` and `en` is greater than `maxL`, it updates `maxL`, `maxS`, and `maxE`.

6. Finally, it returns the substring of `s` from `maxS` to `maxS + maxL` as the longest palindromic substring.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character in the string, it potentially iterates over all characters in the string.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) as it only uses a few integer variables to keep track of the length and the start and end indices of the longest palindromic substring.

Example: Given the input string `babad`, calling `longestPalindrome(s)` will return `bab`, which is the longest palindromic substring. If another palindrome of the same length exists, such as `aba`, it will return the one that appears first.
