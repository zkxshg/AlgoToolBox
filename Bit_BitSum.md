The algorithm in `Bit_BitSum.cpp` computes the sum of two integers without using arithmetic operators like `+` or `-`.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The algorithm's purpose is to compute the sum of two integers `a` and `b` using bit manipulation.

**Input:**
The algorithm takes two integers `a` and `b` as inputs.

**Output:**
The algorithm returns an integer which is the sum of `a` and `b`.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. The algorithm first checks if both `a` and `b` are negative numbers. If both are negative, it changes them to positive and sets the `nega` flag to true.
2. The algorithm then enters a while loop that continues until `b` becomes 0.
3. In each iteration of the loop, the algorithm first computes the XOR of `a` and `b` and stores it in `tem`. This operation essentially adds the bits of `a` and `b` without considering the carry.
4. It then computes the AND of `a` and `b`, shifts the result 1 bit to the left (which is equivalent to multiplying it by 2) and assigns it to `b`. This operation gives the carry bits.
5. The algorithm then assigns the value of `tem` to `a`. The previous steps are repeated until there are no more carry bits, i.e., until `b` becomes 0.
6. If the `nega` flag is true, the algorithm returns `-a` as the result, otherwise, it returns `a`.

**Time complexity: O(1)**, because the time complexity is not dependent on the size of the input and bitwise operations on integers take constant time.

**Space complexity: O(1)**, because it uses a fixed amount of space and doesn't depend on the input size.

This algorithm uses bitwise operations to perform addition. The XOR operation gives the sum without the carry, and the AND operation followed by a left shift gives the carry. 

For example, if `a = 3` and `b = 2`, the output would be `5` because the sum of `3` and `2` is `5`.
