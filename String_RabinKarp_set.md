The algorithm in `String_RabinKarp_set.cpp` implements an optimized version of the Rabin-Karp string-searching algorithm. This algorithm searches for multiple patterns (from `wordDict`) in a text string `s` simultaneously.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main objective is to identify the starting positions of all strings in `wordDict` within the string `s`.

**Input:**
The function `RabinKarp` receives a string `s` and a vector of strings `wordDict`.

**Output:**
`RabinKarp` returns a vector of integers, representing the starting positions of all strings in `wordDict` found within `s`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. It starts by initializing an empty results vector and an empty dictionary to store the hash values of all words in `wordDict`. The maximum length of words in `wordDict` is also determined.

2. Each word in `wordDict` has its hash value calculated and stored in the dictionary. Additionally, the function calculates the power of the prime base raised to the maximum length of words minus one.

3. The function then calculates hash values for all prefixes of `s` and stores them in a vector `hashes`.

4. It iterates through each character in `s`. For every character, it iterates through each word in `wordDict`. If the length of the word does not exceed the substring of `s` starting from the current character, it calculates the hash value for that substring. If the hash value matches the hash value of the word and the actual strings are identical, the current index is added to the result vector. The current index indicates the starting position of the word in `s`.

5. After iterating through all characters in `s`, the function returns the results vector.

**Time Complexity:**
Assuming a sparse hash function and a small-sized `wordDict`, the time complexity of the algorithm can be approximated to O(k * (n + m)), where k is the average length of a word in `wordDict`, n is the length of the string `s`, and m is the size of `wordDict`. This time complexity assumes that hash collisions are rare and operations like insertion and retrieval on the hash set (dictionary) are average-case constant time.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n + m), as it creates a dictionary of size m (the number of words) and a vector of size n+1 (the length of the string `s` plus one).

**Example:** Given the string "applepenapple" and the word dictionary ["apple", "pen"], calling `RabinKarp("applepenapple", ["apple", "pen"])` will return [0, 5, 9], which are the starting positions of "apple" and "pen" in "applepenapple".
