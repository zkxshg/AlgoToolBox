The algorithm in `List_ReverseLinkList.cpp` is designed to reverse a singly linked list.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main goal of this algorithm is to reverse the order of the nodes in a given singly linked list.

**Input:**
The function `reverseList` takes a pointer to the head node of a singly linked list.

**Output:**
The function returns the head node of the reversed linked list.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. The `reverseList` function first checks if the list is empty or has only one node, in which case it simply returns the head.

2. It then iterates over the original list to find the last node.

3. It calls the `reverseLink` function on the head of the list.

4. The `reverseLink` function recursively reverses the rest of the list and makes the next node of the current node point to the current node.

5. The `reverseLink` function returns the current node, but the `reverseList` function returns the last node found earlier, which is now the head of the reversed list.

6. It also sets the next node of the original head node (which is now the last node) to `NULL`.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited exactly once.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the list. This space is used for the recursive call stack in the `reverseLink` function.

For example, if a linked list has nodes with values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be the list with nodes in the order `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, which is the reversed list.
