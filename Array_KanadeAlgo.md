**Goal of Algorithm:**
Kadane's Algorithm is designed to solve the Maximum Subarray Problem, which is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.

**Input:**
The input to the algorithm is a one-dimensional array of numbers. The array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

**Output:**
The output of the algorithm is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the input array. The version of the algorithm provided in your previous queries also returns the starting and ending indices of the maximum subarray.

**Time complexity: O(n).** Kadane's Algorithm scans through the input array exactly once, making its time complexity linear.

**Space complexity: O(1).** The algorithm maintains only a constant amount of variables to keep track of the current subarray and the maximum subarray found so far, so its space complexity is constant.
