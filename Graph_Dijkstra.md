The algorithm in `Graph_Dijkstra.cpp` is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is designed to find the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes within a graph.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The primary goal of this algorithm is to find the shortest paths from the source node (here, node 0) to all other nodes in a given graph.

**Input:**
The function `Dijkstra` takes a 2D vector `edges` representing the edges in the graph with their corresponding weights, and an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the graph.

**Output:**
The function `Dijkstra` returns a vector `dist` where `dist[i]` is the shortest distance from the source node to node `i`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize the `dist` vector with `INT_MAX` (a representation of infinity) and set the distance to the source node (`dist[0]`) to 0.

2. Convert the edge list to a more convenient adjacency list (the `path` map), which maps each node to a map of its adjacent nodes and the corresponding weights.

3. Initialize a priority queue `nodes` that will store pairs of nodes and their current shortest distance from the source node. The queue is ordered using the `cmp` struct, which ensures that the node with the shortest distance is always at the top of the queue.

4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the node `N` with the shortest distance. If the current distance is greater than the shortest known distance `dist[N]`, skip this node.

5. For each node `v` adjacent to `N`, if the distance to `v` through `N` is less than the current shortest known distance to `v`, update `dist[v]` and enqueue `v` with its new distance.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm can be considered as O((V+E)logV), where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges, assuming the usage of a binary heap for the priority queue.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V), because in the worst case, every vertex will be inserted into the queue. 

For example, if a graph has 3 nodes with edges represented as `[[0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 1], [0, 2, 4]]` (each sub-array represents an edge between the first two numbers with the third number as the weight), the output will be `[0, 3, 2]`, indicating that the shortest distance from node 0 to node 0 is 0, to node 1 is 3, and to node 2 is 2.
