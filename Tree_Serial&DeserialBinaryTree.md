The algorithm implemented in `Tree_Serial&DeserialBinaryTree.cpp` is designed to solve the problem of serializing and deserializing a binary tree. Here, serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. 

The algorithm uses depth-first search (DFS) and preorder traversal (root, left, right) to serialize and deserialize the binary tree.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The main goal of this algorithm is to serialize a binary tree into a string and then deserialize that string back into the original binary tree.

**Input:**
For serialization, the function `serialize` takes the root of a binary tree as input.
For deserialization, the function `deserialize` takes a string `data` as input.

**Output:**
The `serialize` function returns a string that is the serialized version of the tree.
The `deserialize` function returns the root of the binary tree that is deserialized from the input string.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Serialization:** The algorithm converts the binary tree into a string representation by traversing the tree in a preorder manner (root, left, right). It appends each node's value to the string, followed by a comma. If a node is null, it appends a "#" to the string. It uses recursion to traverse the entire tree.

2. **Deserialization:** The algorithm uses the input string to rebuild the binary tree by interpreting the string from left to right. It uses recursion to build the left and right subtrees of each node in a manner that corresponds to the preorder traversal used in the serialization process. It handles negative values and multi-digit numbers correctly.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of both serialization and deserialization is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the algorithm processes each node exactly once.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of both serialization and deserialization is also O(n), due to the space required for the output string in the serialization process and the call stack space in the deserialization process.

For example, consider a binary tree with the root node value 1, left child value 2, and right child value 3. The `serialize` function will return the string "1,2,#,#,3,#,#,". The `deserialize` function will take this string as input and return the original binary tree.
