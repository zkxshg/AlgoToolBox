The algorithm implemented in `Math_AngleOfClock.cpp` calculates the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a given time.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The algorithm's goal is to return the smaller angle formed between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a specified time.

**Input:**
The algorithm takes two integers as input: `hour` (0-12) and `minutes` (0-59), representing the time on a clock.

**Output:**
The algorithm returns a double, representing the smallest angle (in degrees) between the hour and minute hands at the specified time.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. If the `hour` is 12, set `hour` to 0 to adjust the hour hand to the start of the clock.
2. Calculate `result` which represents the absolute difference between the positions of the hour and minute hands on the clock. The multiplication and division by 30 and 60 are based on the fact that each minute represents 6 degrees and each hour represents 30 degrees on the clock. The `(minutes - (hour + 1) * 5) * 6` part adjusts the hour hand's position based on the minutes past the hour.
3. If the `result` is greater than 180 degrees (which means it's the larger angle on the clock), subtract it from 360 to get the smaller angle.
4. Return the `result`.

**Time complexity: O(1)**, the algorithm performs a constant amount of work regardless of the input size (hour and minutes).

**Space complexity: O(1)**, the algorithm uses a constant amount of space to store the hour, minutes, and result.

This algorithm provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at a given time.

For example, given `hour = 3` and `minutes = 30`, the output would be `75.0`. This is because at 3:30, the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands of the clock is 75 degrees.
