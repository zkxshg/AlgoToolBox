The algorithm in `Random_ReservoirSampling.cpp` is an implementation of the reservoir sampling technique used to randomly select an index from a set of indices whose corresponding values in an array equal a given target.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main goal of this algorithm is to randomly select an index from the indices that point to the target value in the array.

**Input:**
The `Solution` class constructor takes a vector of integers `nums` as input. The `pick` function takes an integer `target` as input.

**Output:**
The `pick` function returns an integer representing an index from the array where the value matches the target.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. The `Solution` class constructor initializes the `A` vector with the input vector `nums`.

2. The `pick` function initializes `n` to 1 and `res` to 0.

3. It then iterates over the `A` vector. For each element that equals the target, it generates a random number `ran` between 0 and `n-1`.

4. If `ran` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it updates `res` to the current index `i`.

5. It increments `n` after each match.

6. Finally, it returns the index stored in `res`.

This algorithm is based on the reservoir sampling technique. It ensures that every index that points to the target has an equal probability of being chosen.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the `pick` function is O(N), where `N` is the size of the array. This is because it checks each element of the array once.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1), disregarding the space needed to store the input array. This is because the algorithm only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `n`, `res`, `len`, and `ran`.

Example: If `nums` is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]` and `target` is `3`, calling `pick(target)` will return an index from the array where the value is `3`. The index returned is randomly selected from the set `{2, 3, 4}`.
