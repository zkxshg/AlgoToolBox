The algorithm in `Math_MultiplyStrings.cpp` multiplies two large numbers represented as strings.

**Goal of the Algorithm:**
The main goal of this algorithm is to multiply two large numbers that are given as strings. This is useful when dealing with numbers that are too large to be represented within the normal integer data types.

**Input:**
The function `multiply` takes two strings `num1` and `num2` as input, each representing a large number.

**Output:**
The function returns a string representing the product of the two input numbers.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. The function first checks for edge cases where either of the inputs is 0 or 1.

2. It then initializes a vector of integers `result` with size equal to the sum of the lengths of the two strings minus 1.

3. The function then performs the multiplication operation for each digit of the two numbers in a nested loop, storing the result in the `result` vector.

4. A new vector `rplus` is created by adding a 0 at the beginning of `result`.

5. The function then corrects for cases where a digit of the result is greater than 9 by carrying the excess to the next digit.

6. If the first digit of `rplus` is 0, it is removed.

7. Finally, the function converts the `rplus` vector back to a string and returns the string.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N*M) where `N` and `M` are the lengths of the input strings. This is because for each digit in `num1`, the algorithm performs a multiplication operation for each digit in `num2`.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(N+M) as it uses two vectors `result` and `rplus` to store the intermediate and final results of the multiplication.

Example: If `num1` is `"123"` and `num2` is `"456"`, the output will be `"56088"`, which is the product of 123 and 456.
