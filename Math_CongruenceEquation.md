The algorithm implemented in `Math_CongruenceEquation.cpp` calculates the possible time on a clock, given the degrees of the three hands of the clock.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The algorithm's goal is to calculate the possible time on a clock, given the degrees of the hour, minute, and second hands. 

**Input:**
The algorithm takes three long long integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, which represent the position of the three hands on the clock.

**Output:**
The algorithm outputs the possible time in the format: `hour`, `minute`, `second`, and `nanosecond`.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. The algorithm starts by taking the number of test cases `t` as input.
2. In a loop that runs `t` times, it takes three inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are the degrees of the three hands on a clock.
3. It checks all six possible combinations of hour, minute, and second hands for a valid time:
   - if the combination `c`, `b`, `a` is valid, it assigns `h = c`, `m = b`, and `s = a`.
   - if the combination `c`, `a`, `b` is valid, it assigns `h = c`, `m = a`, and `s = b`.
   - and so on, for all six combinations.
4. For each valid combination, it calculates the corrected hour (`h`), minute (`m`), and second (`s`) values by subtracting `r` from each and taking the modulus `k`.
5. It then converts these corrected values into actual hours (`hi`), minutes (`mi`), and seconds (`si`) by dividing by `t2d` and then by 30 for hours, and 6 for minutes and seconds.
6. It also calculates the nanoseconds (`hs`) from the remaining `h` value.
7. Finally, it outputs the calculated time in the format: `hour`, `minute`, `second`, and `nanosecond`.

**Time Complexity: O(1)**, it performs a constant amount of work for each test case.

**Space Complexity: O(1)**, it uses a constant amount of space.

The algorithm provides an efficient way to calculate the possible time on a clock given the degrees of the three hands.

For example, given `a = 0`, `b = 1`, and `c = 2`, the algorithm will calculate and output the possible time.
