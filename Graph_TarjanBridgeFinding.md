The algorithm in `Graph_TarjanBridgeFinding.cpp` implements Tarjan's algorithm to identify all the bridges in a graph.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The goal of this algorithm is to find all the "bridges" in a graph. A bridge in a graph is an edge that, if removed, increases the number of connected components.

**Input:**
The algorithm takes an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the graph, and a 2D vector `connections` as input. Each subvector in `connections` represents an edge between two nodes.

**Output:**
The algorithm returns a vector of vectors `res`, where each subvector represents a bridge in the graph.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize vectors `id` and `low` of size `n` to keep track of the ids and low-link values of each node. Also, initialize `index` to 1, which will be used to assign ids to the nodes.
2. Construct an adjacency list representation of the graph using `connections`.
3. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) from each node `i` if it has not been visited yet (`id[i]` is 0).
4. During the DFS, for each node `tem`, assign it an `id` and a `low` value. For each neighbor `next` of `tem`:
   - If `next` has not been visited yet, perform a DFS from `next`, and update the `low` value of `tem` as the minimum of its current `low` value and the `low` value of `next`.
   - If `next` has been visited and is not the parent of `tem`, update the `low` value of `tem` as the minimum of its current `low` value and the `low` value of `next`.
   - If the `low` value of `next` is greater than the `id` of `tem`, then the edge from `tem` to `next` is a bridge. Add this bridge to the result.
5. Return the result list of bridges.

**Time complexity: O(V + E)**, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges in the graph. This is because the algorithm performs a DFS from each unvisited node, visiting each node and edge once.

**Space complexity: O(V + E)**, due to the storage of the adjacency list and the `id` and `low` vectors.

This algorithm uses Tarjan's algorithm to efficiently find all bridges in a graph.

For example, given `n = 4` and `connections = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [1, 3]]`, the output would be `[[1, 3]]`. This is because the edge from node 1 to node 3 is a bridge; removing it increases the number of connected components in the graph.
