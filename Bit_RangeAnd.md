The algorithm in `Bit_RangeAnd.cpp` computes the bitwise AND operation on all numbers in the inclusive range `[m, n]`.

**Goal of Algorithm:**
The algorithm's purpose is to compute the bitwise AND of all numbers from `m` to `n`, inclusive.

**Input:**
The algorithm takes two integers `m` and `n` as inputs, which represent the starting and ending of a range, respectively.

**Output:**
The algorithm returns an integer, which is the result of the bitwise AND operation on all numbers from `m` to `n`.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize a counter `cou` to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of right shifts performed on `m` and `n`.
2. Enter a while loop that continues until `m` and `n` become equal.
3. In each iteration of the loop, right shift `m` and `n` by 1 bit and increment `cou` by 1. The right shift operation effectively halves the values of `m` and `n`.
4. When `m` and `n` become equal, it means we've found the common prefix of `m` and `n` in their binary representation. The remaining bits to the right in the range from `m` to `n` will be both `0` and `1`, and hence their AND will be `0`.
5. Finally, shift `m` (or `n`, since they're now equal) back to the left by `cou` bits and return this value. 

**Time complexity: O(log n)**, where `n` is the maximum number in the range. The while loop runs until `m` and `n` become equal, which in the worst case could take `log n` iterations.

**Space complexity: O(1)**, because the space usage does not grow with the size of the input range. It uses a fixed amount of space to store the two input numbers and the counter.

This algorithm uses bitwise operations to efficiently calculate the bitwise AND of all numbers in a given range.

For example, given `m = 5` and `n = 7`, the output would be `4` because the bitwise AND of `5` (`101` in binary), `6` (`110` in binary), and `7` (`111` in binary) is `4` (`100` in binary).
