The algorithm in `UnionFind_QuickUnion.cpp` is designed to solve two different problems:

**Problem 1: Smallest String with Swaps** 
The goal of this problem is to return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing some number of swaps among pairs of indices in the string.

**Input:** 
The function `UnionFind` takes a string `s` and a vector of pairs of integers `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [a, b]` means you are allowed to swap the characters at indices `a` and `b`.

**Output:** 
The function returns the lexicographically smallest string after some number of swaps.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize a union-find structure.
2. For each pair of indices in the input, unite them in the union-find structure.
3. For each connected component in the union-find structure, get the indices that belong to that component and the corresponding characters in the string. Sort these characters.
4. Replace the characters at the indices of each connected component with the sorted characters.
5. Return the resulting string.

**Problem 2: Largest Component Size by Common Factor**
The goal of this problem is to find the largest connected component in a graph where vertices are the integers in the input and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if they share a common factor greater than 1.

**Input:** 
The function `largestComponentSize` takes a vector of integers `A`.

**Output:** 
The function returns the size of the largest connected component in the graph.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize a union-find structure.
2. For each integer in the input, unite it with its factors in the union-find structure.
3. Count the number of integers that share the same parent in the union-find structure.
4. Return the maximum count.

**Time Complexity:**
For both problems, the time complexity of the algorithm is approximately O(n log n), where n is the size of the string in the first problem and the number of integers in the second problem. This is mainly due to the sorting operation and the union-find operations which are approximately O(log n) each.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of both algorithms is O(n), due to the space required for the union-find structure and the additional data structures used to store the indices or the counts.
